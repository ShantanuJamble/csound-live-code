# Using the live.csound.com Web Application 

[https://live.csound.com](https://live.csound.com)

This repository contains a single-page web application within the web folder. This web application uses the Web Assembly version of Csound to embed Csound into the web page and deliver a full Csound-based live coding environment through the web--no installation required.    
When the web application is loaded, the livecode.orc library is evaluated and the framework (i.e., clock) is started.  The site is ready to go and the user can select code and press ctrl-e to evaluate the code.
