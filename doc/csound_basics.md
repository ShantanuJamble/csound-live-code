# A Basic Introduction to Csound

## Overview

[Csound](https://csound.com) is an open-source sound and music computing system.  Originally written by Barry Vercoe, Csound is developed in the C programming language and derives from the earliest of computer music software (from Max Matthews' MUSIC-IV to Vercoe's MUSIC-360, then MUSIC-11, then Csound). It has evolved from its non-realtime, desktop application roots to become a commandline compiler, a realtime sound server, and library capable of realtime synthesis and processing. Since Csound 6, Csound supports live coding.
